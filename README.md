Research Questions:

1. How widespread is the phenomenon of directors re-using the same crew?

2. Do renowned directors (and women/minority directors) tend to work persistently with the same key collaborators and do less recognized directors tend to work with shifting groups of collaborators?

3. What are the properties of the film-director network? 
 
4. Are there any interesting nodes/links?
