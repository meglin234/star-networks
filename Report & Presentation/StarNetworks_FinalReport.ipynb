        "Some renowned film directors have a long-standing working relationship with key collaborators. For example, Wes Anderson and Alexandre Desplat have collaborated on several films, including \"The French Dispatch,\" \"Isle of Dogs,\" and \"The Grand Budapest Hotel.\" It is not uncommon for directors to work with the same cinematographers, production designers, or editors across multiple projects. These role recurrences for a singular director may be common practice in the film industry, as they allow directors to establish a consistent artistic vision. These frequent collaborations may foster a sense of trust and understanding between the director and crewmember, resulting in a distinct artistic style associated with the director. This practice can be observed in both male and female directors, where female directors also form long-standing partnerships with professionals that share their artistic vision."

        "In order to answer our research questions, we first needed a dataset of directors and their crew members. To accomplish this task, we wrote a Python script titled \"data_extraction.py\", that takes a file containing directors and their information (\"100_film_directors.csv\"), gets the crew members each director has worked with using \"imdb_scraper.py\", and stores the extracted data into a nested folder structure. The \"main()\" function, supported by the other function in the Python script, is responsible for reading \"100_film_directors.csv\" and extracting all the relevant director-crew data at once. This function represents the overall logic and thought process that went into writing the code and accomplishing the data extraction subtask. A simple explanation of the \"main()\" function is provided in the pseudocode below. For more details about the code, please refer to the code for the \"main()\" function, also provided below, and the Python script \"data_extraction.py\"."

        "We hypothesized that directors would reuse their crewmembers often - our analysis concludes otherwise. Our research indicates that crewmembers used at least twice occur in an average of 10% of all directors. However, it is still not uncommon for directors to work with a core group of collaborators. As our research further indicates, directors often reuse those in specific departments, such as music and film editing, while sound and makeup are the least reused. Music and film editing directly affect the audience's experience while watching a film. While the roles of sound and makeup are important, they may not offer as many opportunities for recurring collaborations. While the director's vision guides the overall sound design, sound production's technical and detailed nature may lead to working with different sound designers depending on the project. Similarly, with makeup departments, makeup artists must cater specific needs of characters and visual aesthetics of a film, leading to a broader range of collaborators."
